## Configuration

### Required ACF Fields

Create an ACF field group for **Attachments** with these fields:

| Field Name | Type | Description | Required |
|------------|------|-------------|----------|
| `photographer` | Text | Photographer name | Yes* |
| `photographer_website` | URL | Photographer website | No |
| `cc_license` | Select | Creative Commons license | Yes* |
| `cc_license_link` | URL | License URL (auto-filled) | No |
| `acquire_license_page` | URL | License purchase page | No |
| `copyright_notice` | Text | Custom copyright text | No |

*At least one of `photographer` or `cc_license` is required for schema generation.

### CC License Options

Configure your CC License select field with these values:

- `CC BY` - Attribution
- `CC BY-SA` - Attribution-ShareAlike  
- `CC BY-NC` - Attribution-NonCommercial
- `CC BY-NC-SA` - Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike
- `CC BY-ND` - Attribution-NoDerivatives
- `CC BY-NC-ND` - Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives
- `CC0` - Public Domain

### Plugin Settings

- **Target Categories**: Select which post categories should include schema markup
- **Target Tags**: Select which post tags should include schema markup
- **Auto-generate Copyright**: Automatically create copyright notices from credit data
- **Default License Page**: Fallback URL for license acquisition
- **Include Sitemap Data**: Add image credits to WordPress XML sitemaps

**Schema Generation Logic**: Schema markup is generated when posts match ANY selected category OR ANY selected tag (OR logic).

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Upload images** to Media Library first
2. **Add ACF data** to each image (photographer, license, etc.) and save
3. **Insert images** into posts using the media picker or Gutenberg blocks
4. **Assign categories and/or tags** to posts according to your plugin settings
5. **Publish posts** - schema markup is automatically generated

### Schema Generation Logic

Schema markup is generated when posts meet ANY of these conditions:
- Post belongs to ANY selected target category, OR
- Post has ANY selected target tag

**Example**: If you configure categories "photolog" and "travel", plus tags "photography" and "creative-commons", then schema will be generated for posts that:
- Are in category "photolog" OR "travel", OR  
- Have tag "photography" OR "creative-commons"

> **Important**: Always upload images to Media Library before adding ACF data. Due to how ACF works, the photo credit fields are only available after the image has been uploaded and saved as an attachment.

### Workflow Recommendations

For best results, follow this recommended workflow:

1. **Upload images to Media Library first** - This ensures ACF fields are available
2. **Fill out ACF fields for each image and save** - Complete all photographer and license information
3. **Insert images into posts** - Use "Add Media" button, Gutenberg Image blocks, or Gallery blocks
4. **Assign appropriate categories and/or tags** - Configure posts to match your plugin settings
5. **Publish posts** - Schema markup will be automatically generated based on your category and tag settings

> **Note**: The plugin detects images in post content using WordPress CSS classes (`wp-image-ID`) and modern Gutenberg data attributes (`data-id`). Images inserted from the Media Library or Gutenberg blocks will automatically have these identifiers.

### Gutenberg Compatibility

Version 1.3.0+ includes enhanced support for:

- **Image blocks**: Traditional single image blocks
- **Gallery blocks**: Multi-image gallery layouts
- **Media & Text blocks**: Combined text and image blocks
- **Cover blocks**: Background image detection
- **Classic Editor**: Full backward compatibility

The plugin automatically detects images regardless of how they were inserted into your content.

### Updating Existing Posts

For existing sites with many posts, you can trigger schema regeneration by:

- **Manual method**: Edit and re-save posts with updated image data
- **Batch method**: Use a one-time function in `functions.php` to programmatically update posts (advanced users)

> **Advanced**: Batch updates can be automated via custom PHP functions. Always backup your database before running batch operations.

### Schema Output

The plugin generates structured data including:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "ImageObject",
  "contentUrl": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  "creator": {
    "@type": "Person", 
    "name": "Photographer Name"
  },
  "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",
  "creditText": "Photo by Photographer Name / CC BY 4.0",
  "acquireLicensePage": "https://example.com/licenses"
}
```

## License Acquisition Fallback

The plugin uses an intelligent fallback system for license acquisition pages:

1. Individual image `acquire_license_page` field
2. ACF field default value  
3. Plugin settings default license page
4. Photographer website as last resort
